                If you watch the training and go through the cheat sheet and still feel like you
                have no clearer path to fixing your ads, you owe me nothing.

                If you book the 1:1 audit and, by the end of the call, you don&apos;t feel like you
                know exactly what to do next, I&apos;ll refund the 197, no questions asked.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just reply to your confirmation email within 7 days and say refund please, you&apos;ll
                have your money back within 24 hours.

                I can make this promise because I know the game you&apos;re playing and I&apos;ve seen what
                happens when people finally install a real system.

                If you show up and do the work, results stop being a mystery and start being math.
